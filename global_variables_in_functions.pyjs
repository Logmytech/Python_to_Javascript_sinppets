In JavaScript unlike in Python every variable, even those declared inside functions are global by default.

For example
function my_function() {
my_int = 6;
};
is roughly equal to

def my_function():
    global my_int = 6

While

function my_function() {
    var my_int = 6;
};
is roughly equal to

def my_function():
    my_int =6


To make a variable local var is used.
var my_int = 1;
